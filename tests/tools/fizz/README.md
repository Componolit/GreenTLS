This patch for [Fizz](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fizz) allows to write out decrypted handshake messages. When this patch is applied, each handshake message is written to a separate file that is enumerated in the order in which it was received. By running the sample application `fizz client -connect localhost:443` you can obtain the handshake messages that the client receives.
