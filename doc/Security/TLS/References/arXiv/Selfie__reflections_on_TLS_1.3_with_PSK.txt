====== Selfie  reflections on TLS 1.3 with PSK ======
Created Dienstag 23 April 2019

- https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/347.pdf

TLS 1.3 allows out-of-band provisioning of PSKs.
If parallel client and server sessions on one host is allowed, a MITM attacker is able to reflect the connection attempt back to the same host and thus cause a connection to itself.
A TLS 1.3 server is not able to detect such a scenario, as no further authentication will be performed in PSK mode.

Proposed mitigations:
- Disallow external PSKs.
- Enforce use of certificate authentication with external PSKs.
- Disallow sharing one PSK between more than one client and one server.
- Cache all generated nonces and reject incoming connections with cached nonces.
- Enforce use of SNI extension.
