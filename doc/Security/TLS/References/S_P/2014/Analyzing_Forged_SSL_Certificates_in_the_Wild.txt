====== Analyzing Forged SSL Certificates in the Wild ======

- https://www.linshunghuang.com/papers/mitm.pdf

Each CA can issue a certificate for any website. Thus only one trusted CA has to be compromised to affect all websites in the internet.
A Flash Player plugin was developed which is able to detect forged certificates.
Proposed mitigations:
	- HSTS, public key / certificate pinning (HPKP, TACK, DVCert)
	- TLS-OBC
	- certificate validation with notaries
	- certificate audit logs (Certificate Transparency)
	- DNS-based authentication (DANE)
