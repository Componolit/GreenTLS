====== Using Frankencerts for Automated Adversarial Testing of Certificate Validation in SSL/TLS Implementations ======

- https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak14.pdf

Various TLS implementations do not validate certificates correctly.
Synthetic certificates ("frankencerts") that are randomly mutated from real certificates are used to test implementations.
